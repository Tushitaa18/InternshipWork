This project, titled Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis and Visualization, focuses on 
transforming raw customer data into meaningful insights that businesses can use to better 
understand their customers. The key objective of this project is to analyse customer purchasing 
patterns and trends. With the ever-increasing amount of customer data, businesses often find it 
challenging to extract actionable insights. My goal was to bridge this gap using data analytics 
techniques, providing businesses with information that helps them make data-driven decisions, 
improve customer engagement, and refine their marketing strategies
